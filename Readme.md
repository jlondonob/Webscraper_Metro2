# Colombian Real Estate Listings Scraper

## About The Project

There are currently few existing datasets that monitor the state of the Colombian real estate market. Unfortunately, they are privately held and not available to the general public. This project attempts to collect this data using scraping techniques with the end goal of making it available to all interested public.
